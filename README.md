# On primes
## Finding primes
I wrote [bitman](https://pypi.org/project/bitman/) while revisiting the problem of generating primes. Generation of prime numbers can be easy or difficult task depending on how deep you delve into the problem or the volume of primes you have to generate. I looked at it from a relatively easier perspective. Take a look at the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_of_primes) for generation prime numbers. 

**Task:** Generate prime numbers from 1 to N where N is an integer.

* An incomplete task will be in normal font

The following have been implemented:

* **Erastothenes sieve** |[.py](https://github.com/subimal/On-Primes/blob/main/PrimeSieves/Erastothenes.py)|
* **Sundaram's sieve** |[.py](https://github.com/subimal/On-Primes/blob/main/PrimeSieves/Sundaram.py)|

## A wiki
I am putting up a [wiki](https://github.com/subimal/On-Primes/wiki/On-Primes) that you might find useful.
