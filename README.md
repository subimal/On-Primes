### Finding primes
I wrote bitman while revisiting the problem of generating primes. Generation of prime numbers can be easy to a very difficult task depending on how deep you delve into the problem. I looked at it from a relatively easier perspective. Take a look at the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_of_primes) for generation prime numbers. 

**Task:** Generate prime numbers from 1 to N where N is an integer.

* An incomplete task will be in normal font

The following have been implemented:

* **Erastothenes sieve** |[.py](https://github.com/subimal/On-Primes/blob/main/PrimeSieves/Erastothenes.py)|
* **Sundaram's sieve** |[.py](https://github.com/subimal/On-Primes/blob/main/PrimeSieves/Sundaram.py)|
